	* dime.dsp, src/main/Application.cpp, src/main/Application.h,
	src/main/DimeServices.h, src/services/gui/EventGenerator.h: Three
	changes rating: minor/bugfix -Ok MSVC #ifdef's in to avoid use of
	ERIS.  -Made a few variables initialise to NULL in eventgenerator
	to fix segfaults -Added a few items to the MSVC project file

2002-04-24 15:38  aglanor

	* src/main/: Application.cpp, Application.h, DimeServices.h,

	MetaserverService is included, can be instantiated and is polled
	each step of the main loop

2002-04-20 14:44  xmp

	MSVC specific stuff that we need. Such as no partial instantiation,
	correct use of namespaces, and returning values at the end of
	non-void functions

2002-04-20 11:12  nikal

	* src/services/gui/Event.h: still more files

2002-04-20 11:10  nikal

	work properly.

2002-04-20 10:18  xmp

	* src/services/platform/SDLDrawDevice.cpp: Added include <stdlib.h>

	services/platform/Rectangle.h: Dime is now using the event
	generator, and events have been sped up.  (previously we were only
	processing one event per screen refresh.  now we process all events
	the do the screen refresh.)  The event system is very close to
	being in place, new widgets will come over the next few days.

2002-04-15 21:18  nikal

	* src/services/gui/: EventGenerator.cpp, EventGenerator.h,

2002-04-15 20:13  nikal

	* src/services/gui/: EventGenerator.cpp, EventGenerator.h,

2002-04-14 22:52  nikal

	* src/services/gui/: EventGenerator.cpp, EventGenerator.h,
	GuiService.cpp, GuiService.h, Widget.cpp, Widget.h: Added
	EventGenerator.h/cpp.  this doesn't compile but i'm tired.
	Hopefully adamgreg will be able to fix it tonight, if not, i'll fix
	it tomorrow

2002-04-14 19:00  nikal

	* src/services/platform/RectangleRenderer.cpp: Stopped RRs from
	updating each time they drew something.  I added the update into
	the GuiService.cpps draw method, which updates once after drawing
	everything.  This removes the flicker, but doesn't speed it up much
	as blits are still being done each redraw. :

2002-04-14 17:14  nikal

	* src/services/gui/: Button.h, Container.cpp, Container.h,
	GuiService.cpp, GuiService.h, Makefile, Makefile.am, Panel.h,
	Widget.cpp, Widget.h: Removed Container.* and depandancies on them.
	 This is due to the nasty circular depandancy widgets and
	containers had.  And the fact that the Composite pattern requires
	this.  Hope Adamgreg is paying attention

2002-04-13 20:22  nikal

	* scratchpad/: FontService.cpp, FontService.h:	adding some
	preliminary FontService files for adamgreg to play with

2002-04-08 00:51  adamgreg

	services/platform/Rectangle.h,
	services/platform/RectangleRenderer.h,
	services/platform/SDLDrawDevice.h: 
	Added simple panels. Cleaned up the way my Gui code was using
	SDLDrawDevices instead of the DrawDevice base class. Made
	GuiService get the root widget dimensions properly. Moved
	Rectangle.h and Dimension.h to services/platform/ because they're
	used there and not just in the gui, and are pretty useful for other
	things. Probably did some other things I've forgotten about :).
	Mostly just cleaning it up.

2002-04-06 23:19  adamgreg

	* src/: main/Dime.cpp, services/image/ImageService.h: 
	altered ImageService to use media files in dime/bin .
	dime/src/main/data can now be removed.

2002-04-06 22:38  adamgreg

	services/gui/Container.cpp, services/gui/Container.h,
	services/gui/GuiService.cpp, services/gui/GuiService.h,
	services/gui/Widget.h: 
	Made GuiService draw widgets to a DrawDevice associated with it. So
	that the Gui can now be drawn to areas other than the main screen
	if desired. Also more general for when an OpenGL version turns up.

2002-04-03 00:17  tim

	* dime.dsp: MSVC project fixed

	services/gui/Button.h, services/gui/Container.h,
	services/gui/Widget.cpp, services/gui/Widget.h,
	services/platform/RectangleRenderer.cpp,
	services/platform/RectangleRenderer.h: 
	Fixed segfault when destroying some widgets. Added standard and
	highlight RectangleRenderers to Button. Made RectangleRenderers use
	the new Rectangle class. Added another (blank for now) constructor
	to RectangleRenderer to make it fetch themescheme info to
	initialize itself with.

	* configure.in, src/main/Dime.cpp, src/main/Makefile.am,

	src/services/platform/RectangleRenderer.cpp,
	src/services/platform/RectangleRenderer.h: 
	Added Rectangle class for Widget to use. Later should make RR use
	it too so that people creating widgets don't have to worry about
	calling Rectangle::getSDL_Rect(). Kept Dimension, for defining
	max/min/pref dimensions. Quite a few functions in Rectangle so that
	they'll play nicely together.  Messed a bit with nikal's
	ImageService - added image caching. There's a complete
	implementation using Boost shared pointers, which is commented out
	for now because I don't know if many people have or want the boost
	dev files. Incomplete implementation that loads but doesn't unload
	from cache properly.  Did some tidying of RectangleRenderer, and
	tried to make it a bit safer and easier to use. And implemented
	bitmap type RRs using ImageService and DrawDevice.  ...pretty
	bitmapped buttons! (now nikal won't shout at me :)

2002-03-30 20:43  nikal

	* src/services/image/: ImageService.cpp, ImageService.h:
	ImageService 0.0.1 now works. It loads images, and searches paths
	for them.  You can add search paths but not delete them.  Next
	iteration will allow for deleting search paths, and will cache
	instances of an image so there are no more than one instance in
	memory per time, and that the instance is deleted when no longer
	needed.

	Button Widget added. Widget events work. Proper use of
	RectangleRenderers.  The upshot is : pretty thing on screen that
	does stuff. Check it out!

2002-03-29 22:23  nikal

	* configure.in, doc/template_header.h: fixing configure.in to
	include services/platform

2002-03-29 22:17  nikal

	platform/DrawDevice.h, platform/RectangleRenderer.cpp,
	platform/RectangleRenderer.h, platform/SDLDrawDevice.cpp,
	platform/SDLDrawDevice.h: commiting fixed RectangleRenderers, which
	compile and use DrawDevice's to do their rendering.  Makefiles
	should now also try and compile the platform stuff via automake
	etc.

2002-03-29 15:37  nikal

	* src/services/platform/: Color.h, DrawDevice.h, SDLDrawDevice.cpp,
	SDLDrawDevice.h: Added Color.h which is a simple Color
	encapsulation allowing division multiplication addition and
	subtraction.  Updated DrawDevice.h and SDLDrawDevice.* to do
	Gradients and to use the Color class

2002-03-27 21:29  adamgreg

	* src/: main/Makefile.am, services/gui/Makefile,

	MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!

2002-03-27 19:35  adamgreg

	* src/main/DimeServices.h: 
	Added line to initialize GuiService to DimeServices.h

	* ChangeLog, acinclude.m4, configure.in: 2002-03-27 Dan Tomalesky
	<grim@xynesis.com>     * Added eris into configure.in and added the
	m4 macro for eris into	     acinclude.m4 so that configure reports
	nicely that you don't have it	    instead of crazy automake
	errors.

2002-03-27 00:39  adamgreg

	* src/services/gui/Makefile.am: 
	Whoops, forgot to cvs add the Makefile.am I added to

	src/services/gui/GuiService.cpp, src/services/gui/GuiService.h,
	src/services/gui/Makefile, src/services/input/InputDevice.h: 
	Added automake stuff for GuiService (I think). Added int
	getAxis(int) function prototype to InputDevice.h so that
	InputDevice.cpp would compile. Fleshed out constructor of
	GuiService

2002-03-25 22:16  nikal

	* src/services/platform/: DrawDevice.h, Makefile.am,
	SDLDrawDevice.cpp, SDLDrawDevice.h: Adding the DrawDevice
	interface.  Adding the SDLDrawDevice implementation of the
	DrawDevice Interface.  After being accused of pre-mature
	optimizational type thougts, and pleading guilty, I decided to get
	this done so we could start using it.

	Containers now process mouse input from InputService. Currently
	only motion events leading to firing of onMouseEnter and
	onMouseExit signals. The input service and dimension files being
	commited I haven't made any actual changes to :-/

2002-03-24 18:00  adamgreg

	* src/services/: gui/GuiService.cpp, gui/GuiService.h,

	and supporting functionality to it. ParaGui stuff is gone now.
	Added root container widget to GuiService and a system to pass a
	draw message down the widget tree, though it's not going to get
	anywhere useful yet.  This is a first attempt, so be gentle. ;)

2002-03-16 21:46  nikal

	fixes: - changed sdl to SDL in includes (ie SDL/SDL_events.h
	instead of sdl/SDL_events.h - changed scoping of "i" in
	InputService::~InputService so that is in scope - added CPPUnit
	(version 1.6.2) as a requirement of Dime - created makefile for
	Input service - added Input service to subdirs to be built
	
	A side note: - there are a number of warnings about passing strings
	through "...".	By ISO C++ this is not allowed, only primative data
	types can be passed by value through "..."

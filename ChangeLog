    * Added more macros to acinclude.m4 to make configure a bit
      more robust in the face of missing packages and so on.
    * Added a note to INSTALL about currently needing nasal.ttf

    * Added eris into configure.in and added the m4 macro for eris into 
      acinclude.m4 so that configure reports nicely that you don't have it
      instead of crazy automake errors.

    * Added GuiService to the main build process, with suitably disastrous results :D

Dime Service Usage: Narrative Overviews

Overview:

This document contains brief narrative overviews of the intent and usage of
Dime's various services.  It is intended to supplement, not replace, in-source
documentation.


Config Service:                                        (Last updated 2002.06.12)

Config service allows configuration data to be set or loaded from file at
runtime and then, if desired, saved out to file.  On the back end, it makes
calls via the varconf library.  No minimum version is specified, though perhaps
0.52 should be picked.

Key/value pairs are used to store/retrieve values.  The keys are also organized
into sections.  Conceptually, this is very similar, if not identical, to the
.INI format used on Windows.  Note that (AFAIK), the service only supports one
map space -- presumably why varconf supports sections.  The result of loading a
configuration space from file after other sections were created has not been
tested, though the case should probably be documented here, if not in the 
header.

Specific operations (see header for signature):

getInstance() returns a reference to Config Service's singleton.  Note that 
start() and stop() are *unrelated* to the instance's creation and destruction.
Their purpose is somewhat hazy at this time. :)

getValue() retrieves the value of the appropriate section and key; setValue() is
the complementary operation.  itemExists() and deleteItem() are both complement-
ary and are well described in the source documentation.  loadSavedConfig() and 
saveConfig() are probably self-explanatory, as well, but check the in-source
docs if not.

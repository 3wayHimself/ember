 *
 * This is the base unit for representing an Eris::View instance graphically in the Ogre component of EmberOgre.
 * An instance of this is created when an Eris::View instance is available, and destroyed along with it. It's responsibility is to handle the Ogre scene (along with a main camera, movement controllers etc.).
 * It in many ways acts as a hub through which many other subsystems can access both the Ogre and the Eris state of the world.

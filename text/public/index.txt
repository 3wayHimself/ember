<p><h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>
  Welcome to the unofficial Dime website. This site is in the process of being migrated from Zope to cvs2web.  Links will probably link back to the old site, may not work, and in general act funky.  Please contact nikal on IRC, or email me using that name, and the server is telusplanet.net.  Thanks! </p>
  
  <p>Dime is an effort to build a modularized WF client which will run easily on Win32, Unices, and eventually on Macs.  It's in the early stages of development which means it compiles, and nothing more.

      We've had another flurry of activity.  Xmp has gotten sear's console widget to work!!!  Adamgreg is back and has been working hard at refactoring the RectangleRenderers, which will soon be renamed "Renderers".  nikal has been working on themes and should have something by mid-week.  sir_botchalot has joined and has been looking into fixing the fonts.

      We have had a flurry of activity over the past few months, starting with Adamgreg's Widgets, and finishing with Unicode support.
      There is still a lot to be done, and a lot of corners to be polished, but dime is coming along quite nicely.
      We now have textboxes and Labels, and buttons. 
      The data model is nearing it's first real release, and we are nearing a usable version of dime.
      Keep up the good work guys!

      Dime 0.1.0 was released.  It contains our current work up until now, which is a basic framework, some services,
      and an application that starts but doesn't do anything.  A CVS tag named "dime_0_1_0" was created in forge/clients/dime/.

       went through status updates, welcomed a new developer, tbp, who will be working with nikal on GuiService, discussed the features 
      to be implemented for the next release (Dime version 0.2.0), and discussed the way the GuiService and InputService should get the input
      from SDL.

       We also started collecting a <a href="features.html">list of features for iteration 2</a> (and sometimes later iterations).

<p><h2>Meetings and Discussions</h2></p>
<p><h3><a href="http://brenda.worldforge.org:8080/logs/dime/dime_index.html">IRC Bookmarks</a></h3>
Bookmarks of Dime discussions and meetings on IRC (#dime at irc.worldforge.org).</p>
<p><h2>Documents</h2></p>
<p><h3><a href="concept_doc.html">Dime Concept Document</a></h3>
This document describes the history and motivations that led to the
starting of the Dime client, and our goals for it.</p>
<p><h3><a href="developer_doc/battleplan.html">Battleplan for Dime</a></h3>
The dime battleplan, detailed goals for the near future and general goals up to version 1.0.</p>
<p><h3><a href="features.html">Dime Task List and Project Plan</a></h3>
<p>Contains the list of features to be implemented for Dime divided up into suitably sized 
tasks, and with notes of which ones should be implemented in the current iteration.
Focus is on features to be implemented in release  two (version 0.2.0).
</p>
<p>We will work towards release two in many iterations, each about a month long, 
and each increasing the minor version number (0.1.1, 0.1.2, etc).
</p>
<p>Also contains some project metrics.

<p><h3><a href="developer_doc/design.html">Dime Design Document</a></h3>
The core Dime system is built as an application framework.
It consists of Services, a central Data Model, Components, Scripting capability, and Interface Layout support.
This document provides a view to the internal design of Dime.</p>
<p><h3><a href="developer_doc/services.html">Services</a></h3>
Services provide various low level services to higher level platform and implementation independent
components and scripts.  This document describes what Services are in more detail, and what services we will implement for Dime.</p>
<p><h3><a href="developer_doc/data_model.html">Data Model</a></h3>
The Data Model allows components and scripts to use and monitor information provided by different services,
and to set properties and invoke actions provided by services, through a standardized interface.
This design document takes a closer look at the Data Model, and the standard directory structure it will have in Dime.</p>

<p><h2><a href="working_notes/">Working Notes</a></h2>
This section contains various design notes 
produced during development, that are used 
for communicating between developers, and to put down designs or ideas.  They are normally not kept
up to date, but they are listed here in cronological order 
so that new developers can follow the trail of ideas.</p>
<p><h3><a href="developer_doc/development_methodology.html">Dime Development Methodology</a></h3>
Various practices and rules borrowed from XP and other places, that we try to follow.</p>
<p><h3><a href="developer_doc/data_model_fw.html">Data Model Framework Implementation</a></h3>
An implementer's view on the Data Model. The question is, how to keep both, the effort of using it and providing additional branches of the directory structure, to a minimum.</p>
<p><h3><a href="developer_doc/architecture.html">Architecture document</a></h3>
The modules and libraries that make up the Dime client, and their internal dependencies and roles.
<p>
<i>Out of date, as it seems we will not split up dime itself in different libraries, or if we do, in a generic framework
library and in a Dime application that implements dime specific services and functionality, and uses the framework.</i>
<span class="TODO">TODO: Update this document to mainly describe the external libraries we use.</span>
</p></p>
<p>
<i>[Outdated, we can implement docking panels in a better way (a docking panel can accept drag & dropped docking panels to any of it's edges,
to the center of it (creating a tab), or to the seam between two docking panels that it contains).  Ask zzorn for details.]</i>
</p></p>
<p><h3><a href="working_notes/theme_format.html">WF Theme Proposal The</a></h3>
Prposal for generic theme format to use for new WF clients.</p>

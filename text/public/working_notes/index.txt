<h1>Working Notes</h1>
<p>
This document contains various design notes 
produced during development, that are used 
for communicating between developers, and to 
put down designs or ideas.  They are normally not kept
up to date, but they are listed here in cronological order 
so that new developers can follow the trail of ideas.

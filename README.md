# Ember

Ember is a fully featured client for the Worldforge virtual world system.
It can be used for playing and exploring as well as authoring.

That means that if you're a player who wants to explore a virtual world hosted by a Worldforge server, this is the client for you.
And if you're a world builder who wants to build your own world, this is also the client for you.

To learn more about Worldforge visit our [website](http://worldforge.org/ "The main Worldforge site").

## Installation

Since Ember uses a lot of internal Worldforge libraries which might not be supplied by your system we strongly suggest that you use the [Hammer](http://wiki.worldforge.org/wiki/Hammer_Script "The Hammer script") tool to compile Ember.
This is script provided by the Worldforge project which will download and install all of the required libraries and components used by Worldforge.

## Running Ember

As Ember is a 3d client it requires a 3d capable graphics card. If you have a fairly recent machine you should be good though.

If you want to run Ember as a world builder tool we strongly recommend that you also install and run a local instance of the [Cyphesis](https://github.com/worldforge/cyphesis "Cyphesis server") server.
By running an instance of the Cyphesis server on your local machine you're automatically given administrative access to the world, and can build and alter it however you like.
Just as with Ember we recommend that you use the [Hammer](http://wiki.worldforge.org/wiki/Hammer_Script "The Hammer script") tool to compile Cyphesis.

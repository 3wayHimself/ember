****************
* dependencies *
****************

Dime currently depends on the following libraries:

SDL
Simple DirectMedia Layer
Version: 1.2.3 or 1.2.4 (depending on version of SDL_image you install, below)
http://www.libsdl.org

SDL_image
SDL image library
Version: Any? (SDL_image 1.2.2 is tested, but requires SDL 1.2.4)
http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/index.html

SDL_mixer
SDL mixer library
Version Any? (SDL_mixer 1.2.3 is tested)
http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/index.html

libsigc++
install this library from your distro CDs
Version: 1.0.4 or 1.2.0 (support for sigc++-1.0 will be dropped soon)
(needed for Eris, see below)

skstream2
socket stream
Version: CVS 
ftp://victor.worldforge.org/pub/worldforge/libs/skstream
(needed for Eris, see below)

Atlas-C++
C++ implementation of Worldforge Protocol ("Atlas")
Version: 0.4.5
ftp://victor.worldforge.org/pub/worldforge/libs/Atlas-C++
(needed for Eris, see below)

wfmath
Worldforge math library
Version: CVS
(needed for Eris, see below)

Eris
client side session layer
Version: 0.9.6 pref CVS

Varconf
config files stuff
Version: 0.5.2 works dunno about earlier ones

CPPUnit
C++ unit testing Library
Version: >= 1.8.0
http://sf.net/projects/cppunit

Boost
Portable C++ Source Libraries
Version: Any? (Tested with 1.27.0)
http://www.boost.org

Freetype2
A portable font library which includes antialiased fonts.
Version: At least 2.* but the latest would be nice.
http://www.freetype.org
It seems that if you have Freetype1 installed along 
with Freetype2 then we have compile problems. 
We're working on a solution for that.


****************
* installation *
****************
(for Linux/Unix)

execute the following (usual) commands:

./autogen.sh
./configure
make

You'll need to add a TrueType font (.ttf) to dime/bin, in order for Dime to run
(otherwise, it will fail with an assertion immediately). The font must
be named 'nasal.ttf'. Note that at present it is assumed you run dime
by cd-ing to dime/src/main and running ./dime

*******************
* troubleshooting *
*******************

here we'll address typical problems with the installation, and how to fix them

****************************************
* Mandrake 8.1 (and other RPM systems) *
****************************************

When installing SDL (and SDL_image and SDL_mixer) using packages made for your
system, please be aware that you will need *ALL* the libraries and devel
packages it was built against.  These are often not installed by default.  The 
total number for MDK8.1 was about 15 packages.  (Data from Lee's fresh install 
of MDK8.1)

nullstar's addendum: 
Binary and -devel RPMs of the SDL libraries are released for Mandrake and some
other distros, but not Red Hat.  Source RPMs exist, but don't include the -devel
files -- not helpful if you're wanting to compile Dime but not willing to trust
a Mandrake RPM to play nice on RH. I used source/stow. (Of course, you might not
want to trust stow.)

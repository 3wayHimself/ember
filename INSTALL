http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/index.html

SDL_mixer

         to make it let you use it.
http://sf.net/projects/cppunit

Boost

Version: Any? (Tested with 1.27.0)
http://www.boost.org

If you want a 3D gameview (which is not mandatory, and currently not even
supported <grin>) you'll need:

Crystalspace
3D engine
Version: 0.92
http://crystal.sourceforge.net

****************
* installation *
****************
(for Linux/Unix)

execute the following (usual) commands:

./autogen.sh
./configure
make

You'll need to add a TrueType font (.ttf) to dime/bin, in order for Dime to run
(otherwise, it will fail with an assertion immediately). The font must
be named 'nasal.ttf'. Note that at present it is assumed you run dime
by cd-ing to dime/src/main and running ./dime

*******************
* troubleshooting *
*******************

here we'll address typical problems with the installation, and how to fix them

****************************************
* Mandrake 8.1 (and other RPM systems) *
****************************************

When installing SDL (and SDL_image and SDL_mixer) using packages made for your
system, please be aware that you will need *ALL* the libraries and devel
packages it was built against.  These are often not installed by default.  The 
total number for MDK8.1 was about 15 packages.  (Data from Lee's fresh install 
of MDK8.1)

nullstar's addendum: 
Binary and -devel RPMs of the SDL libraries are released for Mandrake and some
other distros, but not Red Hat.  Source RPMs exist, but don't include the -devel
files -- not helpful if you're wanting to compile Dime but not willing to trust
a Mandrake RPM to play nice on RH. I used source/stow. (Of course, you might not
want to trust stow.)

 Troubleshooting

Here we'll address typical problems with the 
installation, and how to fix them

 I get link errors with "Ogre::MemoryManager..."

If you build ogre om debug mode it will use an internal 
memory manager, which can mess with the linking. A 
simple solution is to edit the file 
OgreMain/include/OgreConfig.h and change 

#define OGRE_DEBUG_MEMORY_MANAGER 1 

to 

#define OGRE_DEBUG_MEMORY_MANAGER 0 

This will remove the use of the memory manager even 
from debug builds.

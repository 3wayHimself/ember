This is an old GUI project by Hans Häggström (a.k.a. zzorn).

It uses Allegro, and may also use some Allegro add on libraries.

It may or may not compile.

The code seems fairly well documented, but some classes are a bit long (1400+ lines).
However, some refctoring could clean it up relatively quickly.
It also has solved many of the design issues with creating a GUI toolkit,
so might be worth looking at or perhaps used as a starting point if it feels
good enough.

It looks quite nifty, with fading focus, etc, and has a working text edit 
field with selections.

There's a RHIDE project included, it should contain mention of any libs used.

The fonts that are included are not GPL'd.

MEDIA:

All media has been removed from Dime CVS.  You now need to download the
following tarballs:
dime-media-0.1.tar.bz2         : For common media (sounds, fonts, music,
                                 common graphics, etc.)
dime-media-sdl-0.1.tar.bz2     : For SDL Engine-specific media
dime-media-ogre-0.2.tar.bz2    : For OGRE Engine-specific media which comes
				 with OGRE release
dime-media-ogre-wf-0.2.tar.bz2 : For OGRE Engine-specific media
				 done by worldforge

The media can be retrieved from ftp://<enter media FTP URL here>/<media file>[0] .
To install the media, uncompress the above tarballs to /usr/share/games/dime .
They will create their own directories under media, so you should have something
that looks like the following (if you install all of the media):

/usr/share/games/dime/media/common
/usr/share/games/dime/media/fonts
/usr/share/games/dime/media/music
/usr/share/games/dime/media/ogre
/usr/share/games/dime/media/sdl
/usr/share/games/dime/media/sounds

NOTE FOR DIMEOGRE:

At the moment development for DimeOgre is very experimental. Installation of the ogremedia 
should therefore be in the root of the source directory. When DimeOgre becomes more stable
we'll move it to system path, but for now we'll keep it in the source dir.

Note that the file dime-media-ogre-<version> does not need to be downloaded, you already
have it in the OGRE release. You can simply copy or symlink the media from
<ogre_dir>/ogrenew/Samples/Media
to
<dime_dir>/media/ogre

You still need to retrieve dime-media-ogre-wf-<version>, which is worldforge specific
media for the OGRE engine which does not come with the OGRE release.

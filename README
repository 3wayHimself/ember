MEDIA:

All media has been removed from Dime CVS.  You now need to download the
following tarballs:
dime-media.tar.bz2      : For common media (sounds, fonts, music,
                          common graphics, etc.)
dime-meida-ogre.tar.bz2 : For OGRE Engine-specific media
dime-media-sdl.tar.bz2  : For SDL Engine-specific media

The media can be retrieved from ftp://<enter media FTP URL here>/<media file>[0] .
To install the media, uncompress the above tarballs to /usr/share/games/dime .
They will create their own directories under media, so you should have something
that looks like the following (if you install all of the media):

/usr/share/games/dime/media/common
/usr/share/games/dime/media/fonts
/usr/share/games/dime/media/music
/usr/share/games/dime/media/ogre
/usr/share/games/dime/media/sdl
/usr/share/games/dime/media/sounds
